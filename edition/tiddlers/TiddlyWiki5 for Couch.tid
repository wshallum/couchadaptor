title: TiddlyWiki5 for Couch

This uses https://github.com/wshallum/couchadaptor ([[$:/plugins/wshallum/couchadaptor]]) and uses the built-in sync implementation (shared with [[TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb|http://tiddlywiki.com/static/TiddlyWiki%2520in%2520the%2520Sky%2520for%2520TiddlyWeb.html]])

! Features

* Runs as a [[CouchApp|http://guide.couchdb.org/editions/1/en/standalone.html]]
* Loads skinny tiddlers from [[CouchDB|http://couchdb.apache.org/]] at startup/login
* Subsequently syncs changes back to the server
* Polls for changes from the server

! Issues (inherited from the sync implementation?)

* Modules / plugins stored on the server (not part of the build process) probably won't work
* UI state (eg current tab status) is shared between all users of the wiki, meaning that the UI can spontaneously change in response to a server sync
